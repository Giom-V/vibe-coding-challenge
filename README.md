# AI-Coded App Challenge 2025

Welcome to my "AI-Coded App Challenge 2025"! This repository documents my journey of creating and publishing an application each week, primarily using AI-powered coding assistants.

The first submission is scheduled for **August 1st, 2025**.

## The Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to explore the capabilities of modern AI in software development. Each week, I will tackle a new project, leveraging tools like Google's AI Studio, Gemini Code Assist, and other LLMs such as Claude to generate, debug, and refactor code.

This experiment aims to:

*   Understand the strengths and weaknesses of different AI coding tools.
*   Discover best practices for collaborating with AI on software projects.
*   Build a diverse portfolio of small, functional applications.
*   Share my findings and experiences with the developer community.

## Projects

Projects are organized by week in reverse chronological order. Each project folder contains the complete source code and a dedicated `README.md` file with more details about the application, the development process, and the AI tools used.
