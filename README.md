# AI-Coded App Challenge 2025

Welcome to my "AI-Coded App Challenge 2025"! This repository documents my journey of creating and publishing an application each week, primarily using AI-powered coding assistants.

## What is "Vibe Coding"?

"Vibe coding" is a term I use to describe the process of building software in close collaboration with AI. It's a partnership where I provide the high-level vision, the "vibe," and the AI helps with the implementation details. This could involve generating boilerplate code, suggesting algorithms, debugging complex issues, or even designing UI components. The goal is to stay in the creative flow and focus on the overall feel and functionality of the application, while letting the AI handle the more tedious aspects of coding.

## The Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to explore the capabilities of modern AI in software development. Each week, I will tackle a new project, leveraging tools like Google's AI Studio, Gemini Code Assist, and other LLMs such as Claude to generate, debug, and refactor code.

This experiment aims to:

*   Understand the strengths and weaknesses of different AI coding tools.
*   Discover best practices for collaborating with AI on software projects.
*   Build a diverse portfolio of small, functional applications.
*   Share my findings and experiences with the developer community.

## Projects

Projects are organized by week in reverse chronological order. Each project folder contains the complete source code and a dedicated `README.md` file with more details about the application, the development process, and the AI tools used.
