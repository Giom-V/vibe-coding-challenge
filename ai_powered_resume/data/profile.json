      "summary": "I believe in open communication and sharing information clearly, both the good and the bad. It builds trust and leads to better outcomes.",
      "details": "Example of transparency: During the Stadia 'no-change porting' initiative, I was upfront with partners about the technical limitations and potential risks, which allowed us to collaboratively find solutions instead of facing last-minute surprises. This built long-term trust even when the news wasn't always positive."

      "name": "Teamwork",
      "icon": "fa-solid fa-users",
      "summary": "Success is a team sport. I thrive on collaboration, valuing every team member's contribution to achieve a common goal.",
      "details": "Example of teamwork: On 'Immortals Fenyx Rising', I championed reorganizing teams to be multidisciplinary. This broke down silos between artists, programmers, and designers, leading to a more cohesive and creative gameplay experience. We solved problems faster because everyone felt ownership of the final product."

      "name": "Trust",
      "icon": "fa-solid fa-handshake",
      "summary": "Trust is the foundation of any great team. I empower my colleagues by trusting their expertise and giving them the autonomy to excel.",
      "details": "Example of trust: When managing the Gemini Early Access Program, I trusted the selected startups to provide high-quality feedback. Instead of micromanaging, I provided them with the tools and access they needed and listened to their insights, which directly influenced product improvements."

    {
      "name": "Sensible Processes",
      "icon": "fa-solid fa-sitemap",
      "summary": "Processes should serve the team, not the other way around. I advocate for agile, lightweight processes that remove obstacles and accelerate progress.",
      "details": "Example of sensible processes: While at Ubisoft, instead of rigidly sticking to a waterfall model, I introduced agile principles to the 'Immortals' team. We used Scrum to adapt to creative changes quickly, which was essential for developing a new IP. The process helped us, it didn't hinder us."

      "name": "Fun",
      "icon": "fa-solid fa-gamepad",
      "summary": "A positive and enjoyable work environment is key to creativity and productivity. We spend a lot of time at work, so we might as well have fun doing it!",
      "details": "Example of fun: While the work was intense on Stadia, I made sure to organize team events and celebrate small wins. This created a positive atmosphere where developers felt comfortable sharing ideas and weren't afraid to experiment, which is crucial when working on a new and challenging platform."
